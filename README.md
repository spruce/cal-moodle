# cal-moodle
Node script to automatically convert strange moodle names to shorter one with some customization


This was a project used while studying at HWR-Berlin where the calenders which where accessible where kind of crappy. So I wrote a little tool which would automatically make them nicer to use in fantastical on iPhone.
